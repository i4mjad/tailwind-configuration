## Tailwind Configuration

This repository contains a single file, `tailwind.config.js`, which is designed to replicate the functionality of the breakpoints directive from the deprecated Angular Flex Layout package. This configuration allows you to define and apply custom styles for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.

### Installation

To use this configuration in your project:

1. Make sure tailwind is installed in your project
2. Copy the content of `tailwind.config.js` file into your tailwind.config.js.
